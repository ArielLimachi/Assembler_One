; this short program for emu8086 shows how to keep constant temperature
; using heater and thermometer (between 60째 to 80째),
; it is assumed that air temperature is lower 60째.
 
; thermometer.exe is started automatically from c:\emu8086\devices.
; it is also accessible from the "virtual devices" menu of the emulator.
 
#start=thermometer.exe#
 
; temperature rises fast, thus emulator should be set to run at the maximum speed.
 
; if closed, the thermometer window can be re-opened from emulator's "virtual devices" menu.
