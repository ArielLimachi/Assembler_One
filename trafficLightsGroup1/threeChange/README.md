### Description

The third change that was made was the implementation of an LCD depending on the 5 situations that the user performs, for example:

first case will be shown -> 10000

second case will be displayed -> 01000
    
third case will be displayed -> 00100

fourth case will be displayed -> 00010

fifth case will be displayed -> 00001

For all cases it exits at port 199 and you continue the process.
